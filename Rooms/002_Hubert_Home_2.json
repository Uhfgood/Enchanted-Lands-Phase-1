    "description": "Hubert walks around his home, examining spell books, scrolls, and loose papers, to figure out the best course of action.\nHubert goes to a large crystal ball, which allows him to see into different realms, and he searches for someone to help.\nHubert then spots John, pulls up info about him, and then sees him enter a convenience store, to grab a Benny Wonky Bar.\nHubert puts a silver ticket into a 'magic' mailbox on his desk, which magically appears inside the wrapper.\n\nHubert walks over to the giant crystal ball, and starts to peer into it.  He instructs the crystal ball to show him 3 likely candidates to help him figure out what's going on in the kingdom.  The ball shows 3 likely candidates, Daniel, John, and Harry.\n\nHit 1 if you wish to pick Daniel.\nHit 2 if you wish to pick John.\nHit 3 if you wish to pick Harry.\n\nHit 0 to quit.",
