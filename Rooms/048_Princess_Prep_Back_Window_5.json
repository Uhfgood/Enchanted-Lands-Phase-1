    "description": "As John scans all around the window, he notices a corner brick seems loose.\nAfter prying it away from the building, he uses it to smash in a pane of glass.\nHe reaches around carefully and undoes the latch, and slides open the window.\nHe climbs through to face a basic office desk, and a couple of plants to his left and right.\nOne of the plants seems to be shuddering of it's own accord.\n\nHit 1 to continue.\n\nHit 0 to quit.",
