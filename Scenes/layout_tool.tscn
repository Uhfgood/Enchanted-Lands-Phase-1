Upon opening the wrapper, he notices part of a ticket appear inside, and then he flips it over.
Flipping the ticket over he reads the words on the back.
Looking at the words on the back, he realizes it's not complete.
As he's pondering what to do, another ticket appears inside the open wrapper.
This looks to be intact but different, in that it doesn't appear to have any silver in it.
After flipping it over John recognizes the same words as the partial ticket.
Now holding both the non-silver and partial tickets, he reads all the words off the back.
